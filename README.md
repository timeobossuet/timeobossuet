### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a French student, I am exploring the financial world with a combination of computing and a scientific mindset. 
Currently, I am keeping most of my projects under wraps, as they are often for corporate clients such as the one at this link: https://video.echo-da.fr. 

If you require my assistance or access to my code, please reach out to me at timeobossuet@gmail.com

I recently made this project but it's in development:
